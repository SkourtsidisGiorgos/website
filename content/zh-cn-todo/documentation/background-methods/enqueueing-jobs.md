As you already know from the 5 minute intro, you only need to pass a lambda with the corresponding method and its arguments to enqueue a background job:

<figure>

```java
JobId jobId = BackgroundJob.enqueue(() -> myService.doWork());
```
<figcaption>This enqueues a background job using an instance of MyService which is available during enqueueing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>

```java
JobId jobId = BackgroundJob.<MyService>enqueue(x -> x.doWork());
```
<figcaption>This enqueues a background job without a reference to an instance of MyService. During execution of the background job, the IoC container will need to provide an instance of type MyService.</figcaption>
</figure>


The enqueue method does not call the target method immediately, it runs the following steps instead:

- Analyse the lambda to extraxt the method information and all its arguments.
- Serialize the method information and all its arguments.
- Create a new background job based on the serialized information.
- Save background job to the configured `StorageProvider`.
- After these steps were performed, the `BackgroundJob.enqueue` method immediately returns to the caller. Another JobRunr component, called `BackgroundJobServer`, checks the persistent storage for enqueued background jobs and performs them in a reliable way.

Instead of the static method call `BackgroundJob.enqueue` you can also use the `JobScheduler` bean. It has exactly the same methods as the `BackgroundJob` class. To use it, just let your dependency injection framework inject an instance of the `JobScheduler` bean and continue as before:


<figure>

```java
@Inject
private JobScheduler jobScheduler;
 
jobScheduler.enqueue(() -> myService.doWork());
```

</figure>
 
As before, you also do not need an instance of the myService available if the `MyService` class is know by your dependency injection framework.

<figure>

```java
@Inject
private JobScheduler jobScheduler;
 
jobScheduler.<MyService>enqueue(x -> x.doWork());
```

## Enqueueing background jobs in bulk
Sometimes you want to enqueue a lot of jobs - for example send an email to all users. JobRunr can process a Java 8 Stream<T> of objects and for each item in that Stream, create a background job. The benefit of this is that it saves these jobs in bulk to the database - resulting in a big performance improvement.

<figure>

```java
Stream<User> userStream = userRepository.getAllUsers();
BackgroundJob.enqueue(userStream, (user) -> mailService.send(user.getId(), "mail-template-key"));
```
<figcaption>Enqueueing emails in bulk using the Stream API with an instance of the mailService available</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>

```java
Stream<User> userStream = userRepository.getAllUsers();
BackgroundJob.enqueue<MailService, User>(userStream, (service, user) -> service.send(user.getId(), "mail-template-key"));
```
<figcaption>Enqueueing emails in bulk using the Stream API with an instance of the mailService not available</figcaption>
</figure>

This allows for nice integration with the Spring Data framework which can return Java 8 Streams - this way, items can be processed incrementally and the entire database must not be put into memory.

Of course the above two enqueueing methods can also be done using the JobScheduler bean.

<figure>

```java
@Inject
private JobScheduler jobScheduler;

Stream<User> userStream = userRepository.getAllUsers();
jobScheduler.enqueue(userStream, (user) -> mailService.send(user.getId(), "mail-template-key"));
```

<figure>

```java
@Inject
private JobScheduler jobScheduler;

Stream<User> userStream = userRepository.getAllUsers();
jobScheduler.enqueue<MailService, User>(userStream, (service, user) -> service.send(user.getId(), "mail-template-key"));
```
