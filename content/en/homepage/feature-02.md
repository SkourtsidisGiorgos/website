Background jobs are created in a persistent storage and supports [RDBMS](documentation/installation/storage#sql-databases) like MySql/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2 and also [NoSQL databases](documentation/installation/storage#nosql-databases) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

You can safely restart your application and use JobRunr without worrying about losing jobs.
