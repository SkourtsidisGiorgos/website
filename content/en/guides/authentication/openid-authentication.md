[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an authentication protocol that allows to verify the identity of users and obtain their profile information. JobRunr Pro allows you to use your existing OpenID Provider to secure your [JobRunr Pro Dashboard]({{< ref "/documentation/pro/jobrunr-pro-dashboard" >}} "Dashboard documentation") and its underlying `REST API` by using `OpenIdConnectAuthenticationProvider`. This authentication provider is perfect for enterprise grade access control. 

In this guide, we'll first configure JobRunr to use an OpenID Provider and we'll use [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as our identity provider throughout this guide. Next, we will also map OpenID claims to JobRunr Authorization rules enabling customized access control for each user.

## Prerequisites
- JobRunr Pro Enterprise 7.0.0 or later
- You already know how to configure JobRunr
- Basic knowlegde about OAuth and OpenID.
- You have Keycloak up and running

> NOTE: the JobRunr Dashboard has been tested with the following OpenId providers: 
> - [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
> - [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) / [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
> - [Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra): Microsoft Entra's [needs configuration to be OIDC compliant](https://xsreality.medium.com/making-azure-ad-oidc-compliant-5734b70c43ff). 
> - [Google OIDC](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/identity-platform?hl=en): Google OIDC uses opaque tokens
> - [Spring Authorization Server](https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server)
> - [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html)


## What is `OpenID`
OpenID offers a robust solution for securing the JobRunr dashboard by enabling secure authentication mechanisms. By leveraging OpenID, users can log into the dashboard using their existing credentials from other OpenID providers, reducing the need for managing multiple usernames and passwords and lowering the risk of password-related security breaches. 

This method enhances user convenience without compromising security, as OpenID providers typically offer strong, multi-factor authentication options. Furthermore, integrating OpenID simplifies the authentication process for developers, offering a standardized protocol to support secure logins from various providers. This integration not only ensures a higher level of security by relying on proven authentication mechanisms but also improves the user experience by offering a seamless login process, making it an ideal choice for securing the JobRunr dashboard.

## Enabling OpenID Authentication in JobRunr
### Add the OpenId dependency
First, we need to add the additional dependency to add the OpenID capability inside the dashboard. To do so, you must add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`

<figure style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; margin: 0">

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jobrunr</groupId>
    <artifactId>jobrunr-pro-dashboard-authentication-openid</artifactId>
    <version>{{< param "JobRunrVersion" >}}</version>
</dependency>
```
</figure>

### Configuring the OpenId integration
Next, we need to enable and configure OpenID authentication in the dashboard.

{{< framework type="fluent-api" >}}
To make our JobRunr dashboard use OpenID, we will need to :

```java
// ...

import org.jobrunr.dashboard.server.security.openidconnect.OpenIdConnectAuthenticationProvider;
import org.jobrunr.dashboard.server.security.openidconnect.OpenIdConnectSettings;

// ...

OpenIdConnectSettings openIdConnectSettings = new OpenIdConnectSettings(
    "your-well-known-openid-configuration-url", // you know, your well known openId configuration URL ðŸ˜‰
    "jobrunr-client-id", // the client id ðŸ¤”
    "client-secret", // the client secret ðŸ¤¯
    "scope" // if null, the default "openid email profile" is used
);

JobRunrPro
        .configure()
        // ...
        .useDashboard(usingStandardDashboardConfiguration()
            // ...
            .andAuthentication(new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationProvider(openIdConnectSettings))
        )
        // ...
```
{{< /framework >}}
{{< framework type="spring-boot" label="Spring">}}
In Spring Boot, we just need to configure some properties in the `application.properties` to enable OpenID integration:

```java
org.jobrunr.dashboard.enabled=true
org.jobrunr.dashboard.port=9000
org.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.openid-configuration-url="your-well-known-openid-configuration-url"
org.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.client-id="jobrunr-client-id"
org.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.client-secret="client-secret"
org.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.scope="scope" // optional, defaults to "openid email profile" 
```
{{< /framework >}}
{{< framework type="quarkus" label="Quarkus">}}
In Quarkus, we just need to configure some properties in the `application.properties` to enable OpenID integration:

```java
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.enabled=true
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.port=9000
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.openid-configuration-url="your-well-known-openid-configuration-url"
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.client-id="jobrunr-client-id"
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.client-secret="client-secret"
quarkus.jobrunr.dashboard.openid-authentication.scope="scope" // optional, defaults to "openid email profile" 
```
{{< /framework >}}
{{< framework type="micronaut" label="Micronaut">}}
In Micronaut, we just need to configure some properties in the `application.yaml` to enable OpenID integration:

```yml
jobrunr:
  dashboard:
    enabled: true
    openid-authentication:
      openid-configuration-url: "your-well-known-openid-configuration-url"
      client-id: "jobrunr-client-id"
      client-secret: "client-secret"
      scope: "scope" // optional, defaults to "openid email profile" 
      
```
{{< /framework >}}

In the code snippet above, we configure all the necessary information to the JobRunr Dashboard to integrate with our OpenID Connect provider

## Conclusion
Incorporating the `OpenIdConnectAuthenticationProvider` into JobRunr Pro offers us an advanced solution for managing dashboard access in environments with diverse user needs. This guide has provided the necessary steps to implement user authentication and authorization securely and effectively, thereby significantly elevating the security posture of your dashboard. The `OpenIdConnectAuthenticationProvider` allows for a streamlined integration process with existing identity providers, ensuring that your application adheres to modern security standards while facilitating a seamless user experience.
