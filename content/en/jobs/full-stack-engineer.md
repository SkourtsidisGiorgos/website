## Job Description
### Company Overview:
Located in Leuven, JobRunr is transforming distributed computing and background job processing in Java. With our library, businesses integrate resilient distributed job processing seamlessly into their applications while also adding instant visibility on how their background jobs are doing.

### The Role:
We're seeking a junior full stack engineer. You will contribute to real-world open-source software and engage in all stages of the development process - including interacting with our great customers.

### What We Offer and Ask for:

It would be great if you have experience with back-end development in Java and front-end experience in React. If not, your willingness to learn would suffice â€“ weâ€™ll teach you.
