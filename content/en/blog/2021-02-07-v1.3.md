### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v1.3.0. It is now available for download from Maven Central.

### New features
- __Redis Group Segregation__: Do you want to run multiple JobRunr installations within one Redis cluster? This is now possible thanks to Redis Group Segregation. You can now define a key-prefix for each JobRunr cluster - this allows you to split multiple JobRunr applications within just one Redis Cluster.
