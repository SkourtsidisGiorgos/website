[Josh Long](https://joshlong.com/), the world's most famous developer advocate working for [spring](https://spring.io/) just created an excellent intro to JobRunr. He explains how you can offload work - (like creating reports, sending emails, resizing images, analytics, etc) - out into a cluster or how you can schedule work for later or recurrently from your SpringBoot application. We can highly recommend the video and **don't forget to subscribe to his channel!**.
