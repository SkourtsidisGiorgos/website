### Celebration time!
I'm happy to announce that I will be giving two talks on [Devoxx Belgium](https://devoxx.be/) this year!

- [Monday, October 2 at 18:20<br/>A Java lambda is all you need for distributed background jobs!](https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=2909)<br/>
If you want to learn how JobRunr works and how it can make your life easier, join me for this Tool In Action session where I will tell you how JobRunr started and where I'll do some live coding showing you how you can use JobRunr in your project!
- [Friday, October 6 at 09:30<br/>The developer's guide to making money in the open-source galaxy!](https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=48054)<br/>
In this talk, I'll give you the complete history of JobRunr - from the actual idea, how it became profitable, where we're now and what we've planned for JobRunr!

I look forward to meet you there!
