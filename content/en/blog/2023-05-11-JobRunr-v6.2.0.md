### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v6.2.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v6.2.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. 

This release includes an **important bugfix for people running JobRunr on Windows machines** that was reported by [the community](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/740) and a Pro customer. Sometimes, no jobs were processed on Windows due to a deadlock when querying CPU information. This has now been solved.

On top of that, we did some profiling and made JobRunr a bit faster. Last but not least, we upgraded our dependencies including **Spring Boot 3** and we now also support **Quarkus 3.0**. Support for Quarkus 2.0 and Kotlin 1.6 has dropped as we want to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

For JobRunr Pro customers, we added a very cool and much requested feature: **dynamic queues** or load-balancing!

This means your application can now support **multiple tenants** concurrently. Even in a scenario where one tenant, say Tenant-A, generates millions of jobs while others only create a few, these other tenants won't be left waiting until all of Tenant-A's jobs are completed. Instead, JobRunr utilizes a round-robin load-balancing strategy to ensure each tenant receives balanced job processing, facilitating fairness in processing their jobs.

Read all about [dynamic queues]({{< ref "documentation/pro/dynamic-queues.md" >}}) in the JobRunr Pro documentation!
