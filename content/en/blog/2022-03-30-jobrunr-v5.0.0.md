## Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v5.0.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v5.0.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. As this is a major release, there are also some small breaking changes.

## Some great new features to both JobRunr and JobRunr Pro!
### New features in JobRunr
This release again adds quite some new improvements to JobRunr:
- __Spring Native support__: Thanks to [@JoshLong](https://github.com/joshlong), JobRunr now out-of-the-box supports Spring Native! Use the dependency `jobrunr-spring-boot-native` and your app will launch in milliseconds. Stay tuned for a dedicated blog post on how to use JobRunr together with Spring Native.
- __Scheduled jobs with repeating interval__: since JobRunr 5.0.0, you can now schedule recurring jobs using an interval. This means you can now also schedule recurring jobs as follows: `BackgroundJob.scheduleRecurringly("my-recurring-job", Duration.parse("PT5D"), () -> service.doWork());`
Thank you [@Daniela](https://github.com/daniela-tumbraegel)!
- __MDC support__: this release introduces support for the [Mapped Diagnostics Context](https://www.baeldung.com/mdc-in-log4j-2-logback) of SLF4J. If you have a correlation id available and you log something in your job, this correlation id will still be available. You can even use any value of the MDC context in the [display name]({{< ref "logging-progress.md" >}}).
- __Cron extended with last day of month__: Need to run some jobs on the last day of the month? This is now possible thanks to [@asahaf](https://github.com/asahaf/) as the JobRunr Cron expression parser now supports last-day-of-week and last-day-of-month syntax.
- __Default Number of Retries__: You can now easily change the default number of retries via the JobRunr [Spring Boot Starter]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/spring/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}), the [Micronaut integration]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/micronaut/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}) and the [Quarkus Extension]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/quarkus/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}) configuration.
- __Easier integration with multiple databases__: Are you running the JobRunr [Spring Boot Starter]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/spring/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}), the [Micronaut integration]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/micronaut/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}) or the [Quarkus Extension]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/quarkus/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}) and do you have multiple databases available in your application (e.g. an SQL database and a Mongo DB or ElasticSearch instance)? As of JobRunr 5.0.0, you can specify which database to use in this case thanks to the extended configuration. Just specify the database `type` and JobRunr will select that database.
- __MicroMeter integration__: This release also adds support for MicroMeter in the JobRunr [Fluent Api configuration]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/fluent/_index.md#advanced-configuration">}}).
- __Performance improvement__: Before JobRunr 5.0.0, all the recurring jobs were constantly reloaded from the StorageProvider when JobRunr checked for new work. This is now cached and only reloaded when the number of jobs changes (e.g. a delete happens).
- __Dashboard ‚úã Google__: I noticed that there were some JobRunr dashboards publicly available and indexed by Google. As of now, the JobRunr dashboard has a `noIndex` and `noFollow` meta tag so that your jobs stay private.


### New features in JobRunr Pro
JobRunr Pro also received a lot of new features!
- __Transaction plugin:__ are you running the JobRunr [Spring Boot Starter]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/spring/_index.md">}}), the [Micronaut integration]({{<ref "/documentation/configuration/micronaut/_index.md">}})? Then as of v5.0.0, JobRunr out-of-the-box participates in the [transactions]({{<ref "transactions.md">}}) created by these frameworks.
- __Instant processing:__ JobRunr Pro adds some magic and now comes with instant processing of jobs. Just enqueue a job and processing will instantly begin - no need to wait for the `pollInterval`.
- __Easy JobFilters:__ JobRunr has the concept of `JobFilters` to easily extend the functionality of JobRunr. In JobRunr Pro, this [becomes even easier]({{<ref "job-filters.md">}}) as any Spring / Micronaut / Quarkus bean that implements the `JobClientFilter` or `JobServerFilter` will automatically be registered in JobRunr.
- __Improved serverTags:__ JobRunr Pro uses `ServerTags` to specify on which server a `Job` can run. From now on, you can even limit to run a job on the same server that scheduled it using the annotation `@Job(runOnServerWithTag =  "%CURRENT_SERVER")`
- __enqueueOrReplace and scheduleOrReplace:__ are you creating jobs with your own UUID? By default, JobRunr ignores any new job that is enqueued or scheduled if it was already created before as it allows to process jobs in a [cluster only once]({{<ref "faq.md#im-listening-for-jobs-using-service-bus-messages-in-a-load-balanced-environment-and-i-want-to-schedule-jobs-only-once">}}). But do you need to replace that job for some reason? Using the new `enqueueOrReplace` and `scheduleOrReplace` methods it is now possible to [update existing jobs]({{<ref "replace-jobs">}}) at any point in the lifecycle of that job.
- __Job Results:__ do you want to return the result from your job to a client? JobRunr Pro now captures the result of a job, serializes it to JSON and saves it to the database. Using the JobScheduler, you can then [query for the result of a job]({{<ref "results.md">}}). It comes with a smart query algorithm that takes into account average processing time of that type of job and it makes sure that you don't overload the database if you for example have clients querying for the result in a while loop.
- __Dashboard improvements:__ the [JobRunr Pro dashboard]({{<ref "jobrunr-pro-dashboard">}}) has improved a lot! You can now requeue or delete all failed jobs at once. A real time-saver.

### Breaking changes:
- all existing recurring jobs are not compatible anymore due to the support for recurring jobs using an interval. Please make sure to have no recurring jobs nor scheduled jobs in your application before upgrading.
- the job metadata is now cleared as soon as the job succeeded. There are 2 reasons for this: storage savings in your storage provider and the fact that it was used to return results from jobs without any back-off policy and thus negatively impacting the performance of JobRunr. But, JobRunr Pro now supports returning results from jobs!
- if you are using ElasticSearch, you will need to update your ElasticSearch dependencies as a bug was introduced by Elastic in [ElasticSearch 7.16](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/82357)
- all dependencies have been updated to the latest version - make sure to upgrade your dependencies too.


### üëè Special thanks to ...
