### Celebration time!
Part of the revenue from JobRunr goes to planting trees 🌳 🌴 🌲 and as I'm closing the fiscal year it was about time to plant those trees! So, I'm happy to announce that we're planting [3885 trees using #teamtrees](https://teamtrees.org/search?q=jobrunr)! The reason for this: I think that we should apply the boy-scout rule everywhere, also in the real world 🌍.

And, this is only possible to all the great JobRunr Pro customers - you have my eternal gratitude 🙏. Hopefully we get to 10.000 trees next year!
