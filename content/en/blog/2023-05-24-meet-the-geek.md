### Meet the Geek!
I'm happy to announce the first 'Meet the geek' session! Join me in a live webinar where I'll be coding and am available to answer any question you may have around JobRunr! If this one goes well, I may do other of these meet-the-geek sessions that fit better for other timezones (e.g. APAC or AMER).

Looking forward to see you there!
